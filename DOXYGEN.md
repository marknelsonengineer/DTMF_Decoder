Doxygen Notes
=============

Doxygen is the de facto standard tool for generating documentation from annotated C++ sources

Doxygen's website is:  https://www.doxygen.nl

## Notes
   - I prefer compile my own version of Doxygen (on Linux).  I installed it from
     a Setup file on Windows.
   - We use [DOT](https://graphviz.org ) and [DIA](http://dia-installer.de)

## To integrate Doxygen with Visual Studio
   - TODO... but I wire it into Tools

## To Run Doxygen
   - Install dot graphviz

## To Configure Doxygen
   - I clone the configuration from an existing app, then pick through the config
     line-by-line until I'm happy with it.  I have a lot of customizations, but
     it looks good the way I publish it.
